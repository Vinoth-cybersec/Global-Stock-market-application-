To create an **all-country stock market application** in Django, you'll need to expand the scope by pulling stock data from multiple markets and supporting different countries. You can use a more comprehensive API like [Yahoo Finance API](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) or [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co) (with global market support) to get stock data for multiple countries.

### Features:
1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
2. **Global Stock Market Data**: Search and track stocks from different countries.
3. **Virtual Portfolio**: Users can create a portfolio to track stocks across global markets.
4. **API Integration**: Integration with a stock market API that supports multiple countries.
5. **Django Models**: Store users, global stocks, and portfolios in the database.

# Global Stock Market Application

A Django-based web application that allows users to search and track stock prices from multiple countries, manage a virtual portfolio, and access real-time stock market data using an external API like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out.
- **Search for Global Stocks**: Search for stock data from different countries and stock exchanges.
- **Virtual Portfolio**: Users can track stocks from various global markets in a personalized portfolio.
- **Real-time Stock Data**: Real-time stock prices and information are fetched using a third-party API.
- **Country Selection**: Support for stocks from multiple countries.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django
- `yfinance` or `Alpha Vantage` for real-time stock market data
- `requests` (for API calls)

To install these, run:

```bash
pip install django yfinance requests
```

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-stock-market-app.git
cd global-stock-market-app
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **API Configuration**:

- For real-time stock data, register for an API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) or use the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`).

- Add your API key (if using Alpha Vantage) in the appropriate place in the `views.py` file.

4. **Database Setup**:

Run the following commands to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. **Create a Superuser (Optional)**:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. **Run the Development Server**:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser to access the application.

## Usage

### 1. Registration and Login

- Navigate to `/accounts/register/` to create a new account.
- Log in to the app using `/accounts/login/`.

### 2. Searching for Global Stocks

- Search for stock symbols across different stock exchanges and countries.
- Add stocks to your portfolio to track them.

### 3. Managing a Virtual Portfolio

- Once logged in, users can view their portfolio by navigating to `/portfolio/`.
- The portfolio page shows all the stocks you are tracking, along with their real-time prices.

### 4. Example of Use

1. **Search for a Stock**:

   Enter a stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.) and choose the country or stock exchange (if applicable).

2. **Add Stocks to Portfolio**:

   Add any stock to your portfolio to track its real-time performance.

3. **View Portfolio**:

   Navigate to the portfolio page to view all the stocks you are tracking along with their latest prices.

## External APIs

- **Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)**: Used for real-time stock data fetching. No API key is needed, and you can easily fetch stock data from various global stock exchanges.
  
- **Alpha Vantage**: Alternative API for fetching real-time data. Requires an API key.

### Example API Integration

#### Yahoo Finance:

```python
import yfinance as yf

def get_stock_data(symbol):
    stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    data = stock.history(period="1d")
    if not data.empty:
        return data['Close'][0]
    return None
```

#### Alpha Vantage:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_alpha_vantage_api_key'

def get_stock_data(symbol):
    url = f'https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol={symbol}&interval=1min&apikey={API_KEY}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    if 'Time Series (1min)' in data:
        last_refreshed = list(data['Time Series (1min)'])[0]
        price = data['Time Series (1min)'][last_refreshed]['1. open']
        return float(price)
    return None
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Charting**: Add stock price charts using libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly`.
- **Historical Data**: Fetch and display historical stock prices.
- **Country Filter**: Allow users to filter stocks by country or stock exchange.
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Provide performance analysis and insights based on the user’s portfolio.

### Key Notes:
- **API Selection**: You can choose between `yfinance` (which doesn't require an API key) or Alpha Vantage for more robust data, but it requires an API key.
- **Multiple Countries**: The app allows you to search stocks across different global exchanges, and you can add a country filter to the search.
